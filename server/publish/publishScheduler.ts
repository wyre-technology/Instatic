/**
 * Scheduled publish tick — polls the `data_rows` table for rows where
 * `status = 'scheduled' AND scheduled_publish_at <= now()` and fires the
 * regular publish path on each.
 *
 * Modeled on `server/plugins/scheduler.ts`. Differences:
 *
 *   • One-shot, not recurring. Each scheduled row fires AT MOST ONCE per
 *     `scheduled_publish_at` timestamp. After firing the row's status
 *     transitions to `'published'` (success) or `'draft'` (failure) —
 *     either way it's no longer selected by subsequent ticks.
 *
 *   • No per-schedule cadence math. The target time IS the cadence.
 *
 *   • No run-history table. Failures go to `console.error`. The audit
 *     log captures the publish event itself via the existing
 *     `auditEvent('row.publish.scheduled')` we record next to the call.
 *
 * HA-safety: leader election via the shared `withSchedulerLeaderLock`
 * (`server/db/advisoryLock.ts`), same as the plugin scheduler. Only ONE host
 * instance ticks at a time; SQLite is single-process so the lock is a no-op
 * sentinel.
 *
 * Listing freshness: flipping a row to `published` writes that row's own
 * artefact and nothing else, so every baked listing that loops over its table
 * still shows the pre-publish set. Each fired row asks `autoSitePublish.ts` for
 * a site republish; its batch window collapses a whole tick — up to
 * `TICK_BATCH_LIMIT` rows — into one.
 *
 * Failure policy: when `publishDataRow` throws (e.g. validation fails,
 * the row got deleted between selection and publish), the row is
 * reverted to `'draft'` via `cancelScheduledPublish` and the error is
 * logged. This is the "revert to draft + log error" choice from the
 * scheduling-design discussion — no retry counters, no 'failed' status,
 * the operator sees their row back in the drafts list and retries
 * manually.
